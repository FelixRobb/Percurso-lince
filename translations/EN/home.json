  "azenhas_title": "Azenhas do Guadiana",
  "azenhas_info_content": "Although it is mainly inhabited by people, the town of Mértola is a great place to hear and see a wide variety of creatures, some of them rare, such as the lesser kestrel, present from February to July. Two or three sites near the town are used for nesting by the white-rumped swift, a very discreet African species, present from May to October and with a small European population, only in the south and center of the Iberian peninsula. Azenhas do Guadiana is a river beach in Mértola where, in spring and summer, you can hear the pleasant, short songs of the oriole and the pu-pu-pu of the Eurasian hoopoe. Common nightingales also sing here, and red-rumped swallows nest in old buildings along this stretch of the river. On hot summer days, the southern common cicada sings on the slopes of the river. In this area and on the road bridge in Mértola, you may have the chance to hear the calls of a species from sub-Saharan Africa, the white-rumped swift. Early morning and late afternoon are the best times to try. Species that call all year round are the common kingfisher, the Iberian magpie and the common nightingale. At night, listen out for the song of the Eurasian eagle-owl on the cliffs to the northeast of Azenhas. The winter and spring months are the best, and dusk is the best time to listen. The Mediterranean tree frog and the natterjack toad are other amphibians that can be heard at night in winter or early spring. ",

  "ribeira_title": "Ribeira de Oeiras - Ponte",
  "ribeira_info_content": "This bridge is one of the best places in Portugal to meet an Iberian lynx. There are several territories here, and the lynx uses the stream as a corridor. From November to the beginning of January there is the possibility of hearing a lynx here at night. It's also a great place to hear the dormouse in late winter and spring. In the distance, on calm nights, you may hear a kingfisher or a curlew. From October to March, listen out for thrushes on their nocturnal migration. During the day, from February onwards, listen out for the laughing song of the green woodpecker, as well as the pu-pu-pu of the hoopoe, which will continue throughout spring. The red-breasted nuthatch sings until it migrates in March or April. The common titmouse, another wintering species, does the same. Flocks of Spanish sparrows start to get noisy at the beginning of the year, when the males increase their singing time. Spring highlights include the calls of the collared kingfisher and the song of the common nightingale. The various species of warbler sing more intensely in spring. Bank swallows breed under the bridge. Among the amphibians, the green frogs and Mediterranean tree frog are probably the most common. In late spring and summer, there are bee-eaters passing over the bridge and daurel swallows with their very distinctive songs and calls. During the fall, many migrants pass through, and some may stay a day or more in the bushes near the river. In September, look out for black flycatchers on their way to West Africa and listen out for the arrival of the first robins, the Chiffchaff and thrushes. At dawn or dusk you can hear the crackling and chattering of partridges and, if there's enough water, the calls of waterfowl can be heard here. Other songs that can be heard for much of the year include the shrike, the nightingales, and the two species of magpie.",

  "mertola_title": "Vila de Mértola",
  "mertola_info_content": "In the town of Mértola, any viewpoint overlooking the river can be a good listening post, including Além Rio, a quieter spot on the other bank. During the day, swallows and, in the hottest part of the year, swifts, fly over the river, often in large numbers, catching insects and vocalizing. In winter, the dominant species is the rock swallow, which does not migrate to Africa. Chimney swallows and barn swallows arrive in January and stay until fall. Pallid swifts are present from March until summer and black swifts arrive a few weeks later. The walls around the village offer nesting opportunities for kestrels, rock pigeons and a few pairs of bluebirds, which emit a loud kss-kss-kss, a low coo and a lyrical, pleasant song. All their sounds are modified by echoes off the walls. White storks rapidly tap their beaks on some buildings, and some male of western black-eared wheatear  sing from rocky outcrops. At night, bats replace the birds hunting over the river and the village. If you can hear one, it's probably a European Free-tailed bat; most of the others are beyond the reach of human ears. The common gecko is very vocal for part of the year, calling softly on the walls of buildings. The hooting and screeching of the barn owl sometimes echoes. Near the river you can hear the common toad in winter and the mallard at any time of year. The calls of a grey heron may go unnoticed in the hustle and bustle of the day, but they resonate well in the stillness of the night. If you're lucky, you might hear the high-pitched whistles or “oscillating” cries of a family of otters. Interestingly, Mértola is a good place to hear flamingos! At night they often fly over the town vocalizing, following the river all the way to Castro Marim.",
  
  "pr3_title": "PR3 MTL - As margens do Guadiana",
  "pr3_info_content": "The trail between Corte Gafo de Baixo and Moinho dos Canais is ideal for getting to know the sounds of a wide variety of animals from predators to small creatures. both birds and other animals. Listen to the examples to learn how to identify them in the field. Species such as the long-tailed tit or the blue magpie produce sounds that can be heard at any time of year, but only during the day. Some, like the Iberian lynx, are not only nocturnal, but only vocalize during a few weeks of the year in winter. Spring is the best time to hear birdsong and an early morning visit is recommended, but most amphibians are more vocal in winter and it's on the nights of January and February that you can hear the dormouse. In summer, many species are silent during the day but you may hear bee-eaters and swallows. In open areas listen out for the song of the red-necked nightjar or, near the steep slopes along the Guadiana, the sound of young eagle owls. The sound of the golden eagle, audible on this route, is one of the rarest.",

  "pr5_title": "PR5 MTL - Ao Ritmo das Águas do Vascão",
  "pr5_info_content": "The route from the crossroads near the village of Mesquita to the mouth of the river Vascão takes us through various habitats to a riverside forest at the water's edge, and vice versa. At the start of the trail, distant wind turbines may be audible, but once you reach the bottom you are immersed in a beautiful natural soundscape, generally out of reach of any human-produced sound. The audio highlights are mainly birds, most of them present and vocalizing all year round. The main interest here is in the diurnal species. During the first 500 m the trail crosses an open stony area, once agricultural land, with some olive trees, stone walls and some traces of old structures. Several common tree species can be heard in the olive groves, such as the great tit and, in winter, the common chiffchaff. The area is very popular with Spanish sparrows, which during the non-breeding season can occur in large, noisy flocks. In this area you are likely to see and hear a Iberian Grey Shrike with its terse, tense songs. The area is also good for hoopoe, Thekla's lark and, especially at dawn or dusk, little owl. Now begins a gradual descent. Near a small pine forest on the left, there are bushes on both sides of the path where there is a good chance of hearing warbler songs. During the coldest part of the year, you may hear common warblers before your departure in the spring. Continue downhill to where the trail turns right. Other specialist inhabitants of open habitats can be found in this area: the Rock Bunting, the black redstart and the dunnock. Finally, the trail descends to Vascão and a wide variety of birds can be heard here at all times of the year. Listen out for the soft, whispering song or the high-pitched fT... fT... and sieu of the hawfinch, the varied calls of a flock of titmice or the short, “explosive” exaltations of the nightingale. Perhaps you can hear the simple, almost human whistles of an Eurasian Bullfinch. In every month except May-June, you can hear the high-pitched cries of a frightened Green Sandpiper. In spring or summer, you may hear the radiant song of the oriole or the undulating calls of a flock of bee-eaters passing by.",

  "pr8_title": "PR8 - MTL Moinho do Alferes um Percurso Ribeirinho",
  "pr8_info_content": "If you stop by the bridge that crosses the Vascão for a picnic in spring or summer, listen out for the radiant song of the European golden oriole. The trees to the west of the bridge are a favorite hiding place for the hawfinch, which can betray its presence with explosive fT!... fT!... and a high-pitched sieu. Other birds often audible on the bridge in the warm months include European bee-eaters, red-rumped swallows, common nightingales and, at medium to low frequencies, Eurasian hoopoes and European turtle doves. If you're lucky, you might hear the distant cries of a pair of short-toed snake eagle. At night, listen out for the electric beeps of Iberian midwife toads. The trail continues along the river bank, passing a small orange grove. Between the orchard and the river, on hot days in early summer, you may hear the loud and pleasant song of the rufous-tailed scrub robin. The tallest tree in the area offers its best roost. Several species of birds are dependent on the river. Common kingfishers are present all year round and it's easier to spot them when you recognize their shrill cries. The common moorhen spends much of its time near the aquatic vegetation. Cackles and other calls are often the first clue to its presence. Along the banks you can also find little ringed plovers, which arrive in early spring, displaying at dawn and dusk and especially at night. Green sandpipers emit high-pitched cries when frightened. Species that vocalize all year round include red-legged partridges at dawn, wood pigeons in the trees, shrill Eurasian jays and lively flocks of Iberian magpies. Songs of note among the resident species include the common blackbird with its soft song, ending with a high-pitched flourish, the spotless starlings with their masterful mimicry and swanee-whistles, the songs of the Sardinian warbler, initiated by a single sweet note, the impressive volume of the tiny Eurasian wren, and, in more open areas, Thekla's lark. They all sing mainly in spring, occasionally at other times. In September, it's likely that the the more vocal migrants include the pied flycatcher, and three wintering species: the common chiffchaff, the European robin and the song thrush. An area with a higher density of trees 150 - 400m before Moinho de Alferes serves as a roost for Iberian magpies and, during the colder months, two or three species of thrushes. In the early evening, you can hear the low-pitched call of the Eurasian eagle-owl. Moinho de Alferes is a good place for the red-rumped swallow, common kingfisher, green sandpiper and in spring, a chorus of Iberian green frogs. The common toad can be heard in the quieter stretches of the river. The Mediterranean tree frog can also be heard here."
