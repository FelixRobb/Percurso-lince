In this application, you will find points around the town of Mértola and routes in the Natural Park of the Guadiana Valley with sound recordings of numerous species that you can listen to. The aim is for you to enjoy a new dimension and learn more about the faunal community that coexists with the lynx, depending on the time of day or night, the season, or the location. In addition to recordings collected in the territory by a specialist, photos and brief texts highlighting some curiosities and the biology of the species are presented. Venture into this new discovery of the territories frequented by the lynx. Remember to take all precautions to avoid disturbing the animals, respect private property, and remain silent (staying still at a point can be a good option). We wish you a great experience.",
