As a species in the genus Accipiter, the goshawk is often considered a \"true hawk\".[3] The scientific name is Latin; Accipiter is \"hawk\", from accipere, \"to grasp\", and gentilis is \"noble\" or \"gentle\" because in the Middle Ages only the nobility were permitted to fly goshawks for falconry.[4]",
